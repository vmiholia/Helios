# The "Expert Synthesis" Protocol (Huberman x Attia x Lyon)

This plan re-engineers Ronita's routine using the specific, science-backed protocols of three leading longevity experts.

## 1. The Diagnosis (Through Their Lens)

| Expert | Diagnosis of Ronita's Data | The "Root Cause" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dr. Gabrielle Lyon** <br>*(Muscle-Centric Medicine)* | **"You are not Over-Fat, you are Under-Muscled."** <br> 23.4% Muscle is dangerously low. It effectively lowers your metabolic rate, causing the weight rebound despite high activity. | **Protein Deficiency.** <br> She is likely failing to trigger muscle protein synthesis (MPS) at every meal. |
| **Dr. Peter Attia** <br>*(Longevity & Healthspan)* | **"Your Metabolic Engine is Stalled."** <br> Rising RHR (81 bpm) suggests poor *mitochondrial efficiency*. Spinning is Zone 5 (Peak), but she lacks the Zone 2 (Base) engine to support it. | **Polarized Training Imbalance.** <br> Too much "Junk Miles" (random walking) + "Max Effort" (Spinning) with no "Structural" strength work. |
| **Dr. Andrew Huberman** <br>*(Neurobiology)* | **"Your Autonomic Nervous System is Shifted."** <br> The steady rise in RHR indicates an over-active sympathetic (stress) system. Sleep quality and circadian timing are off. | **Circadian Misalignment.** <br> Likely viewing light at wrong times and not using tools to down-regulate stress. |

## 2. The 3-Month Protocol

### Pillar 1: Nutritional Biochemistry (Dr. Gabrielle Lyon)
*The Goal: Stimulate mTOR (Muscle Growth) to lower biological age.*

*   **Rule #1: The "Leucine Threshold" Breakfast**
    *   **Protocol:** The **first meal** of the day MUST contain **30-40g of high-quality protein**.
    *   *Why?* You need ~2.5g of Leucine (an amino acid) to switch on muscle growth. A coffee + toast breakfast *fails* this, leaving muscle in a catabolic (breakdown) state.
    *   *Action:* 3 Eggs + Whites OR Whey Protein Isolate immediately after morning fast.
*   **Rule #2: 1.6g/kg Protein Target**
    *   **Target:** ~115g Protein / Day.
    *   *Lyon’s Mantra:* "We don't lose weight to get healthy; we get muscle to lose weight."

### Pillar 2: The "Centenarian Decathlon" Training (Dr. Peter Attia)
*The Goal: Build a body that lasts forever (Zone 2 + Zone 5 + Stability).*

*   **The "Zone 5" (Spinning):**
    *   **Protocol:** Keep the 2x/week Chaakraa classes. This hits the **VO2 Max** metric which is highly correlated with longevity.
    *   *Attia’s Note:* Ensure these are truly *hard* efforts (out of breath).
*   **The "Zone 2" (The Missing Link):**
    *   **Protocol:** The 11k steps are good, but are they "Zone 2"?
    *   *Action:* Convert 30-45 mins of the walking into a **continuous, steady-state walk/ruck** where she can talk but doesn't *want* to. This flushes lactate and trains mitochondria.
*   **The "Stability" (Strength):**
    *   **Protocol:** 2x/week Heavy Resistance Training.
    *   *Focus:* Deadlifts/Hinges, Squats, Carries (Farmer's Walk). These prevent frailty.

### Pillar 3: Neuro-Recovery (Dr. Andrew Huberman)
*The Goal: Lower RHR to <75 bpm by fixing the nervous system.*

*   **Rule #1: Morning Sunlight (Circadian Anchor)**
    *   **Protocol:** Get outside for 10-15 mins **within 30 mins of waking**. No sunglasses.
    *   *Why?* Sets the cortisol peak early, ensuring melatonin releases 16 hours later for deep sleep.
*   **Rule #2: NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest)**
    *   **Protocol:** 10-20 mins of "Semicon" or "Yoga Nidra" audio on days she feels "wired but tired" or after a stressful Spinning class.
    *   *Why?* Drastically lowers cortisol and recovers lost sleep debt.
*   **Rule #3: Physiological Sigh**
    *   **Protocol:** Double inhale (through nose), long exhale (through mouth) whenever stressed.

## 3. The Weekly Schedule (Integrated)

| Day | Morning (Huberman) | Nutrition (Lyon) | Training (Attia) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mon** | Sun View + Water | **30g Protein Fast-Breaker** | **Spinning (Zone 5 / VO2 Max)** |
| **Tue** | Sun View | Low Carb / High Protein | **Heavy Strength (Lower Body + Core)** |
| **Wed** | Sun View | Balanced | **Zone 2 Ruck/Walk (45 mins continuous)** |
| **Thu** | Sun View | **30g Protein Fast-Breaker** | **Spinning (Zone 5 / VO2 Max)** |
| **Fri** | Sun View | Low Carb / High Protein | **Heavy Strength (Upper Body + Carry)** |
| **Sat** | Sun View | Re-feed (Moderate Carbs) | **Zone 2 Activity (Hike/Long Walk)** |
| **Sun** | **NSDR (Recovery)** | Fasting Window (14h) | **Rest / Mobility** |

## 4. The Checklist for Success
1.  **Buy a Weighing Scale (Kitchen):** You cannot guess 30g of protein. You must weigh it initially.
2.  **Delay Caffeine:** Wait 90 mins after waking before caffeine (Huberman rule) to avoid the afternoon crash.
3.  **Prioritize Sleep:** Attia states that if you sleep <7h, your insulin resistance rises by 50% the next day. No amount of Spinning fixes that.
